Please note that this design has NOT been tested in real life, it is in beta stage for experienced flashlight builders only. If you don't know what an ampere is, this adapter will likely turn your lamp into a bomb and maim or kill you and others. 


# BOM:

1x Adapter 3D printer.

3x Standard M5 nuts, made from copper or brass.

1x Epoxy glue.


# Instructions:

Place the adapter on a table with the flat side up.
Dab some epoxy on the sides of your nuts, be careful not to get epoxy on the top or bottom.
Push the nuts down through the holes until flat against the table.
The nuts should not be poking out on both sides about one mm. 

The adapter is now ready to be used.

Please use my designs at your own risk, I will not be held responsible if you turn your flaslight into a pipe bomb.
